## Understanding the Approach

First, I worked on a smaller task that could be reused, such as designing the navbar and footer of the webpage. Then, I created the third page, which displayed data in bubbles. I initially made this page with fixed information, but later added dynamic features, like the ability to zoom in and out and view the timeline.

While working on the assignment, I discovered many new libraries that I hadn't explored before. I also learned about data visualization using d3.js, which is a very extensive topic.
